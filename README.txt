## General Information
- multiclass classification model using a custom convolutional neural network in TensorFlow. 
- To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma.
- Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths.
  A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.
- The dataset consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases, 
  which were formed from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC). 
  All images were sorted according to the classification taken with ISIC, and all subsets were divided into the 
  same number of images, with the exception of melanomas and moles, whose images are slightly dominant.

## Conclusions
- The model was able to predict Melanoma efficient but still needs to solve the overfitting
- Although we can not trust 100% on the prediction of our model, but it fairly classifies the images to 9 classes which can be used for double confirmation along with 
	a doctor's recommendation as a first level classification.


## Technologies Used
- Google colab
- tensorflow 2.8
- keras
